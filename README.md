# LawEnforcement
This is a repository for several microservices that support law enforcement. 

The microservices belong in two groups:
1. Enterprise domains - that are used by the application domains
1. Applications domains - that implement features and use case that are specific to law enforcement

The enterprise domains are:
1. Party: person and organisation
2. Object: both tangible and intangible "things" that can be involved in incidents or may be used for evidence
3. Location: the geographical place, or address, or electronic space where an event occurs
4. Event: the occurrence at a given time that is of interest, involving people and/or organisations, objects, and locations
