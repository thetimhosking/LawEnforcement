# Custody Microservice

This is the process of taking a person into, and holding them in, custody. 

The welfare of the person is managed while in custody.

A structured case management process can help to ensure the welfare of the person is cared for.

Additional requirements include:
1. Timing and "stop the clock" for breaks and wait time
1. Involvement of support person, interpreter, etc.
1. Linking to any incident that may occur during the period of custody
